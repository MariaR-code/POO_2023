# POO_2023

In this repository you can find a simple text menu based program created in order to pursue evaluation in Programação Orientada aos Objetos (POO) of university course.

The purpose of the evaluation was to create a marketplace system called Vintage, where it is possible to put products on sale, in case you are a salesman, and buy 
products, in case you a shopper.
In this system you are able to login as a shopper, as a salesman and as both, depending on the setting the person chose when signing in. 
As a shopper you can make an order by choosing which available product or products you want to buy and selecting them. When your done choosing, it will show you the
final price and, if you still want it, you can continue with the purchase.
As a salesman you can put whatever product you want for sale, having to set some of its caracteristics, which will be asked.
If you are loged in as both, you will have both habilities.
Besides, the system will make the managment of such orders and accounts. This means that all the information in the accounts will be stored, like the registration 
data and the orders made by such user. 
For more information about the functionalities of this project you can go to "enunciado".

This project was implemented in Java following the object oriented programming principles, which was the main goal of tne class.
Although me and my group collegues weren't able to complete all of the requirements in this assignament, the work that was done made me understand and learn a lot 
about the principles of object oriented programming.
